## Welcome

We are the **Genetics and Epigenetics research group at Saarland University**, bringing together interdisciplinary groups working at the interface of molecular genetics, epigenomics, and computational biology.

Our research focuses on understanding how genetic variation and epigenetic regulation shape gene expression, cell identity, development, and disease. By combining **experimental genomics**, **epigenetics**, and **data-driven computational approaches**, we aim to uncover fundamental biological mechanisms with relevance to human health.

### Research Areas
- Genetics and functional genomics  
- Epigenetics (DNA methylation, chromatin organization, histone modifications)  
- Gene regulation and regulatory networks  
- Neurobiology and disease-related mechanisms  
- Bioinformatics and computational epigenomics  

### Affiliated Chairs & Groups
This organization reflects the work of research groups at Saarland University, including:

- **Chair of Genetics / Neurogenetics**  
  https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/schulze-hentrich.html  

- **Chair of Genetics / Molecular and Computational Biology**  
  https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/chair/walter.html  

### For Students & Researchers
We welcome students, researchers, and collaborators interested in:
- Open-source bioinformatics tools  
- Reproducible analysis pipelines  
- Epigenomic data analysis and visualization  
- Collaborative research projects  

Relevant resources, code, and documentation will be shared within this organization as part of our commitment to **open and transparent science**.
